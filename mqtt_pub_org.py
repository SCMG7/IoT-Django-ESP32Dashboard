    This is your custom class that is instantiated as the main app object instance,
    it inherits from the supplied IoTApp class found in the libs/iot_app.py module
    which is copied when the Huzzah32 is prepared.
    This IoTApp in turn encapsulates an instance of the ProtoRig class (which is 
    found in libs/proto_rig.py) and exposes a number of properties of this ProtoRig
    instance so you do not have to do this yourself.
    Also, the IoTApp provides an execution loop that can be started by calling the
    run() method of the IoTApp class (which is of course inherited into your custom
    app class). All you have to do is define your program by providing implementations
    of the init(), loop() and deinit() methods.
    Looping of your program can be controlled using the finished flag property of
    your custom class.

    # Some notes on the Hive MQTT public broker: be aware that the MQTT broker used (which
    # is located at "broker.hivemq.com") is a public broker and any topic you publish on
    # will be able to be subscribed to by anyone connected to this broker, the URL for the
    # Hive MQTT public broker web site is:-
    #
    #       https://www.hivemq.com/public-mqtt-broker/
    #
    # There are a few issues to address when using this broker:-
    # 1. It is public, do not use it for sensitive information
    # 2. You need to use unique topic names to ensure you do not clash with existing topics
    #    published to on the broker, this is almost impossible to ensure since you cannot
    #    access the topics being published, however, you should be able to come up with a
    #    pseudo-unique topic name, maybe use the same as below but change the "-00" part
    #    to a number associated with yourself, it is suggested that you look down the list
    #    of people on the CET235 module Canvas entry, count down to your name and use that
    #    as your unique number, so the 8th name would be "-08" and the twentieth name would
    #    be "-20" for instance, hopefully this will prevent clashes with topic names as you
    #    work on your solutions along side all the other students on the module
    # 3. Because the Hive MQTT public broker is beyond our control, it may disappear for
    #    shutdown and maintenance, it has not done in the time it has been used but this
    #    could happen (hopefully for short periods only), that bridge will be crossed if
